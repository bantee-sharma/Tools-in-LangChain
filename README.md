# Tools-in-LangChain

This repository is part of my learning journey in Python tool development. 

It contains basic and custom-built Python scripts to understand how different components like utility functions, bindings, and modular design work together.

**What's included:**

**custom_tool.py:** 

My experiments with creating reusable utility functions.

**tool.py:**

A main script that runs core logic using my tools.

**tool_bindiing.py:** 

Code to connect or bind tools together for combined functionality.

**requirements.txt:** 

All the packages Iâ€™m using for this project.

This project helps me explore real-world practices like writing modular code, handling dependencies, and organizing a Python project effectively.
